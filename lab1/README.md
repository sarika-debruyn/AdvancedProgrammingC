Lab #1

My code almost works exactly as specified in the lab.

------
Instructions:
------
Part 1
------
Write a C program that reads 2 positive integers (of type int) from the user
using scanf() function, prints the following information, and then
terminates:
- the average of the two (this should be printed as a floating point
number.)
- whether each number is a prime number or not
- whether the two numbers are relatively prime or not (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime if you don’t know what this
means.)
You can assume that the user will input only positive integers, i.e.,
don’t do any error checking.
In order to see if two numbers are relatively prime, you should
calculate the GCD using Euclidean algorithm. You are allowed to look
up the algorithm and/or code on the Internet, in which case you should
cite the source in your README.txt file.

Part 2
------
Write a C program called "convert" that reads a signed decimal integer from
the user and prints the number in 4 different ways: signed decimal, unsigned
decimal, hexadecimal, and binary.
